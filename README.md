Solution was built using [cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/). 

### Running Quick Quote solution 

1. Clone this repository into your local directory
1. Initialise the directory using `npm init` or ensure you have a **node_modules** folder or **package.json** file in the root of your project
1. Install cypress via npm:

   ```sh
   $ cd /your/project/path`
   $ npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```
   *Note: For other installation methods like yarn or direct download, click [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#Installing).* 
1. If you used npm to install, Cypress has now been installed to your *./node_modules* directory, with its binary executable accessible from *./node_modules/.bin*.
   Open Cypress Test Runner the long way using the full path:

   ```sh
   $ ./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
   ```
   Or with the shortcut using npm bin
   
   ```sh
   $ $(npm bin)/cypress open
   ```
   After a moment, the Cypress Test Runner will launch.
1. Copy the **bymiles-spec.js** file into *solution/cypress/integration*. The file should automatically appear in Cypress Test Runner. 
1. Click on the file in the Test Runner to run the solution.
